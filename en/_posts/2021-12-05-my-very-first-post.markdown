Hello, world! This is my very first post. It took a while to set up this Github Page along with the Jekyll tool, granted, I'm not a very fast learner. While I try getting used to this markdown syntax, I shall tell the world a little about myself in this very first post.

# Me & IT

My name is Kelvin, I'm a college student majoring Information Systems. I'm interested in System Administration, Computer & Cyber Security, and more. I recently found board/microcontroller programming interesting, so I might take a peek into that as well.
My fascination in IT started when I got my first Android phone where I started to learn about modding and re-flashing ROMs. From there I moved on into more things that are IT related.

# Me & other than IT
When I'm not behind a computer monitor, I enjoy riding motorcycle, playing piano, and violin.

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in taking the course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x&quot;&gt;go to this EDx page&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/&quot;&gt;go to this official page for CS50x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CS50x is one of the largest Computer Science course provided by HarvardX, it’s available online and is free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I decided to finally complete the CS50x course. So in this post, I’m going to explain to you what to expect in this course, my impression, and how much work do you need to complete this course. Let’s start from me.
I wrote down how much time I spent working on the Problem Sets of CS50x, and I spent 47 hours total to complete 10 problem sets, 10 labs, and 1 final project in 8 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;course-structure--more-about-it&quot;&gt;Course Structure &amp;amp; More About It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a course with 10 Lectures, 10 Labs, 10 Problem Sets, and 1 Final Project. (per 2021)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lectures&lt;br /&gt;
One lecture per week, about 1 to 2 hours long.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Labs&lt;br /&gt;
Labs are made to prepare yourself for Problem Sets, usually not as strict as Problem Sets, because you may be allowed to collab with one or two classmates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Problem Sets&lt;br /&gt;
This is the real assignment and is meant to be solved by yourself. This part is known for moderately time consuming and difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final Project&lt;br /&gt;
At the end, you’ll have to submit a final project in form of app. The course gives you freedom in choosing technologies and platforms that you like. You probably will have to create a presentation for it, upload it to YouTube public/unlisted. There is a gallery for the final projects where students who accept, will have their final project displayed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-im-coming-from--what-i-think&quot;&gt;Where I’m Coming From &amp;amp; What I Think&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/fall/faqs/&quot;&gt;CS50’s FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, two-thirds (2/3) of CS50 students have never taken a CS course before. With that said, I’m currently an Information Systems student in my final year, and you can safely assume that I’m familiar with some parts of the course like algorithm, and languages like C and Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reflecting back on it, I’m somewhere in between calling it difficult. It’s definitely not easy for me, it took me a lot of trial and error to solve a Problem Set. A word that fits this course is “challenging”.&lt;br /&gt;
David J. Malan, the lecturer of this course, did a great job teaching this course, the crew also did a great job visualizing lots of concepts to know. The lectures is done very well in explaining things and make them very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-you-get&quot;&gt;What You Get&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ch01NLA.png&quot; width=&quot;370&quot; height=&quot;269&quot; alt=&quot;CS50 certificate&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking this course, you’re going to be much more familiar with hands-on technologies such as C and Python Programming Language, solving problems using algorithms, and you’ll have some insight into how computers use memory to store data, and some insight into Web Development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also if you complete the course and score at least 70% for each assignments, you’ll get an &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/certificate/&quot;&gt;E-Certificate&lt;/a&gt;. My favorite part is that it used to hosted under &lt;a href=&quot;harvard.edu&quot;&gt;harvard.edu’s subdomain&lt;/a&gt;. But I recently moved under &lt;a href=&quot;cs50.io&quot;&gt;cs50.io&lt;/a&gt; instead. But you can still hyperlinks to harvard’s and it will redirect to cs50’s. Still, I do like the fact that it’s associated with Harvard. It brings more leverage aside from the course itself being one of the best free CS course you could take online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CS50 is very worth taking, the lectures are one of the best, and the assignments are challenging.
About difficulty, I’m going to agree with what most people say: CS50 is rather time consuming than difficult. You’re expected to solve way more difficult problems in the Problem Sets than what you get from the Lecture.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kelvin Valencio</name></author><category term="en" /><summary type="html">If you’re interested in taking the course, go to this EDx page or go to this official page for CS50x</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My Very First Post</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/en/2021/12/06/my-very-first-post.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My Very First Post" /><published>2021-12-06T00:35:00+07:00</published><updated>2021-12-06T00:35:00+07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/en/2021/12/06/my-very-first-post</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/en/2021/12/06/my-very-first-post.html">&lt;p&gt;Hello, world!

My name is Kelvin, I’m a college student majoring Information Systems. I’m interested in System Administration, Computer &amp;amp; Cyber Security, and more. I recently found board/microcontroller programming interesting, so I might take a peek into that as well.
My fascination in IT started when I got my first Android phone where I started to learn about modding and re-flashing ROMs. From there I moved on into more things that are IT related.&lt;/p&gt;

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR&lt;/code&gt; is a four-digit number, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MONTH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DAY&lt;/code&gt; are both two-digit numbers, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MARKUP&lt;/code&gt; is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;Tom&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &apos;Hi, Tom&apos; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
